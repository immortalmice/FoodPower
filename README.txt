=== A Minecraft mod about using power from foods. ===

Food will give you power, you already knew it far earlier when you were hungry.
When you were eating roasted potato, roasted beef, raw carrot, you began to notice that it was not quite correct.

ALL THE FOOD CAN BECOME MORE POWERFUL, OVER THE IMAGINATION OF ALL HUMAN KINDS.

You started to "design recipe" with various food and "cook" them into brand new "meals".
You discovered that the meals would bring out the power of the ingredients.
Different ingredients would bring different power.
Of course, the road was not so smooth. You remembered the day you put pork into cake...ewww.

You gain great power by eating the meals you made.
When you were so exciting and reread the recipe you wrote and noticed something is wrong.
As a result, you rewrote a new recipe. No so surprise, new recipe cost fewer ingredients than old one.

As a man loves sweets, you ate lots of sweet food.
Surprisingly, you found your body became lighter than before.
At the meantime, the blind effect came from high blood sugar brought you some inconvinient.
You knew, the flavor of food gave you power.
You can despict the six flavors vaguely.

But, being more powerful, and then?

You discovered there was something like a ceiling, stopping you from gaining more power.
You remembered when you started to make meals and pour the soup onto floor carelessly, you discovered the "three-second rule".
If you...waste lots of food...would something go on?

You took your diamond sword, prepared lots of sweet meals.
You knew, it would be a tough war!
